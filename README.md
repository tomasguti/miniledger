# miniledger
After researching about multiple implementations of distributed ledgers and blockchains, I decided to make my own. Keeping the complexity low.

## Assumptions (can change)
* This implementation is business oriented and not for tokens or cryptocoins.
* All the nodes know the current topology and each others public keys.
* Smart contract is previously installed in the node.
* All the nodes must agree before every transaction. Full concensus. Disagreements will be informed.
* The ledger will be distributed, inmutable and transactions non-repudiable by their creators.

## Proposed Architecture

Under construction...
